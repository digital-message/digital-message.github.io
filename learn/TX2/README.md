> The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the chief architect of the TX-2.

> ..., since [Kleinrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Kleinrock) was using the TX-2 to simulate networks at the same time [Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_(scientist)) was usinging it for visual recognition and [Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland)) was working on Sketchpad, the three of them constituted a kind of TX-2 triumvirate. Among other things, they all presented the oral defense of their Ph.D. theses on the same day, before the same faculty commitee, made up of [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), [Wes Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_A._Clark), and [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky).
