## Constructivism (philosophy of education)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education))

> Constructivism is a theory of knowledge that argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning from an interaction between their experiences and their ideas. It has influenced a number of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, education and the history of science.

## Montessori

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education)

Montessori education is an educational approach developed by Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori and characterized by an emphasis on independence, freedom within limits, and respect for a child’s natural psychological, physical, and social development. 

Although a range of practices exists under the name "Montessori", the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) and the American Montessori Society (AMS) cite these elements as essential

- Mixed age classrooms, with classrooms for children ages 2½ or 3 to 6 years old by far the most common
- Student choice of activity from within a prescribed range of options
- Uninterrupted blocks of work time, ideally three hours
- A constructivist or "discovery" model, where students learn concepts from working with materials, rather than by direct instruction
- Specialized educational materials developed by Montessori and her collaborators
- Freedom of movement within the classroom
- A trained Montessori teacher

In addition, many Montessori schools design their programs with reference to Montessori's model of human development from her published works, and use pedagogy, lessons, and materials introduced in teacher training derived from courses presented by Montessori during her lifetime.

## Seymour Papert

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert)

> At MIT, Papert went on to create the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at the MIT Architecture Machine Group which later became the MIT Media Lab. Here, he was the developer of a theory on learning called constructionism, built upon the work of Jean Piaget in Constructivism learning theories. Papert had worked with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958 to 1963 and is one of Piaget's protégés; Piaget himself once said that "no one understands my ideas as well as Papert". Papert has rethought how schools should work, based on these theories of learning.

## Lego Mindstorms

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)

> The Lego Mindstorms series of kits contain software and hardware to create customizable, programmable robots. They include an intelligent brick computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and Lego parts from the Technic line to create the mechanical systems.

> Mindstorms is named after the book [Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas](http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746) by Seymour Papert.

## Lego Mindstorms: A History of Educational Robots

[Link](http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/10/mindstorms/)

> In the fall of 1984, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen – then the CEO of Lego (and grandson of its founder) – happened to watch a television interview featuring MIT professor Seymour Papert. In it, Papert demonstrated how children could use the programming language he’d developed, LOGO, to control robot “turtles” – to move the robots forward and backward a specified distance, turn right or left a specified degree, drop a pen and draw.

> Lego had created a special education division some years earlier and with the launch of the [Technic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Technic) line had begun to offer construction sets with pneumatics and motors. Kristiansen was struck watching Papert by the similarities between constructionism – Papert’s theory of learning – and his own company’s philosophy about building. Kristiansen was intrigued by the possibilities of expanding Lego’s capabilities for learning and play: children should be able to build and control – program – their creations.

## The missing link

We have successful mass-produced commercial products ([Lego Techinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Technic) and [Lego Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)), [special, expensive and extensive](https://shop.education.lego.com/legoed/en-US/search/navSearchResults.jsp?categoryId=EDU_PRD_LINE_107&ProductLine=LEGO-MINDSTORMS-Education-EV3) educational products and a popular STEM sports franchise ([FLL](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/)), what is the missing link between Seymour Papert's Mindstorms to Montessori style learning?

We believe the key is to shift from **product** and **goal** centered instructional paradigm to **environment** and **context** centered learning paradigm. Technical content and details are intimidating to most parents and teachers who are not technology trained. However most children can absorb new technology as spongy if they are put in the right environment. On the other hand, the "new toy" aspect of technology also tends to shorten children's attention span and miss many important developmental issues. 

A practical approach to build a Lego robotic based **learning environment** is to use Lego Mindstorms system construction and programming as a **language** learning vehicle. Like other real life languages, children learn to listen/read before they can speak/write. Although technical instructions and tutorials are important resources to help children learn to listen/read technically, however, in the age of [Google](http://google.com), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [YouTube](http://youtube.com), and [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [barriers to entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry) for knowledge and skill acquisition become lower and lower (especially true for technology savvy children). We should rethink the role of teachers in this new environment.


## Inspiration

[The Humane Representation of Thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)

> New representations of thought — written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.

> But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.

> Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.

> We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.

> But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.
